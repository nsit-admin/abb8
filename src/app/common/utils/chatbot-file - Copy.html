Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs associated with an audit.  However, if an audit reveals an overcharge of more than three percent (3%) of the audited charges or a material failure by Contractor to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, Contractor will promptly reimburse Customer for the actual cost of such audit (including auditors’ fees) in addition to refunding the amount of the overcharge.</p><h1><a id=\"_Hlk72529178\"></a>[Customer_Property]</h1><h1>[Governing_Law]</h1><h1>Force Majeure; Disaster Recovery.</h1><p>Force Majeure Event.
