        Travel_Reimbursement_Policy: `<h2>SCHEDULE C</h2><p><strong>Travel Reimbursement Policy for American National Red Cross Contractors and Consultants</strong></p><p><em>Because The American National Red Cross (Red Cross) is supported by generous donations from the American public, contractors/consultants are required to limit their travel expenditures to levels that are commensurate with the charitable objectives of Red Cross. </em></p><p>The purpose of the following policy statement is to ensure that all contractors/consultants are reimbursed in a fair and equitable manner for all reasonable expenses that are incurred while traveling on behalf of Red Cross. </p><p>All expenses incurred by contractors/consultants while performing contracted services for Red Cross must be reasonable, actual (no-mark-up) and must be pre-approved by Red Cross in order for the contractor/consultant to receive reimbursement from Red Cross. All expenses must be separately invoiced to Red Cross. Receipts must be submitted for all expenses above $35. Note: Contractors/consultants are not to use any Red Cross forms when seeking reimbursement. </p><p>Contractor/consultants are strongly encouraged to use the Red Cross travel agent (Carlson Wagonlit Travel) to book all pre-approved travel (air, rail, car, and hotel).  Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT) may be reached at 877-292-9466. </p><p><strong>Air/Rail Travel</strong> </p><p>Red Cross strongly encourages contractors/consultants who are traveling on business pursuant to a contract with Red Cross use CWT to book travel. CWT will make reservations for a contractor/consultant travel at the lowest logical airfare. The contractor/consultant should compare ticket costs between what they can obtain from their corporation and CWT and use the least expensive airfare. </p><p>Air/rail charges booked through CWT must be placed on the contractor's/consultant's credit card. All air/rail tickets issued through CWT are subject to a transaction fee. There are no transaction fees for information calls, schedules, or for air/rail, car, and hotel reservations. </p><p><strong>Authorized Class of Service</strong> </p><p><em>Domestic</em><br>All domestic travel must be in Coach Class. </p><p><em>International</em><br>The most economical route must be utilized for all international travel. Red Cross contractor/consultants may upgrade from coach/economy to business class between the "international gateway" and their destination if the uninterrupted travel time from travel origin to first or next business destination exceeds eight (8) hours or more and the business class travel is pre-approved by the Red Cross. </p><p><strong>Lowest Logical Air Fare</strong> </p><p>Contractors/consultants will be reimbursed using the lowest logical airfare. The "lowest logical airfare" is defined as the least costly airfare that uses a regularly scheduled commercial aircraft, using the following parameters: </p><ul><li>routing requires no more than one additional stop over or connection each way; </li><li>departure/arrival must be no more than 2 hour(s) before or after requested time for flights; </li><li>non-refundable and penalty fares must be used, and booked as soon as travel plans are firm. Timing is vital, as substantial savings are available on tickets purchased at least seven (7) to (21) days in advance. </li><li>Contractors/consultants may elect to fly a non-stop flight provided that the additional cost is no more than $100.00 USD per direction of travel; </li><li>When a savings of  &gt;$400may be achieved through the use of an alternate airport in a city served by multiple airports (e.g., Washington, DC – DCA, Dulles, BWI)</li></ul><p><strong>Lodging </strong></p><p><em>Within the Washington metropolitan area </em></p><p>Contractors/ consultants, who are traveling to the Washington, DC area on business pursuant to a contract with the Red Cross must call CWT and reserve rooms at one of the following hotels depending on the location of the place of performance of the services: </p><p><strong>Red Cross Square</strong> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Hotel</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Rate</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Location</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Distance from Red Cross office</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AKA White House</p></td><td><p>$242-$172*</p></td><td><p>1710 H St. NW</p></td><td><p>4 blocks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Club Quarters</p></td><td><p>$242-$172*</p></td><td><p>839 17<sup>th</sup> Street NW </p></td><td><p>4 blocks, also on shuttle route</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Marriott Courtyard Foggy Bottom</p></td><td><p>$230-$202*</p></td><td><p>515 20<sup>th</sup> St, NW</p></td><td><p>4 blocks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Melrose</p></td><td><p>$242-172*</p></td><td><p>2430 Pennsylvania Ave NW</p></td><td><p>11 blocks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>One Washington Circle</p></td><td><p>$242-$172*</p></td><td><p>1 Washington Circle NW</p></td><td><p>10 blocks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hotel RL </p></td><td><p>$242-$172*</p></td><td><p>1823 L St. NW</p></td><td><p>6 blocks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The River Inn</p></td><td><p>$242-$172*</p></td><td><p>924 25<sup>th</sup> St. NW</p></td><td><p>8 blocks </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>State Plaza</p></td><td><p>$209-$179*</p></td><td><p>2117 E St. NW </p></td><td><p>4 blocks</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* based on season and availability</p><p><strong><em>Red Cross locations not within the Washington Metropolitan Area (Other States)</em></strong></p><p>When traveling to a city where Red Cross has preferred hotels, CWT will book the contractor/consultant at the Red Cross preferred hotel.
